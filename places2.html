        <p class="about__description">
          Valugan Boulder Beach is a famous coastal attraction known for its shoreline covered with smooth volcanic boulders instead of sand. The rocks were formed from past eruptions of nearby Mount Iraya and were gradually polished by powerful ocean waves and wind over time.<br>Despite its rugged setting, the beach offers dramatic scenery and a calming atmosphere created by the sound of waves crashing against the stones. However, it is not suitable for swimming because of strong currents and rough terrainea is also used as grazing land, so cows and goats are often seen roaming across the grassy terrain.
